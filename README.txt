4) Add Files from G Drive - this will prompt for oauth and can be used to pull files
from the burnerboard google drive.

5) Reorder Audio + Reorder Video - Drag things around!!

6) get the directory of  media files to download.  Note ORDINAL is used on my end
to maintain order in the DB.  am returning these results in order so it can be ignored.

OPEN QUESTIONS!!!
Are there more Audio and video tracks we want by default?  Will there be some you cannot DELETE?
